    <h2 style="margin-left: 5%; margin-top: 10px;">Less than 6% of Canadians Identify as Indigenous</h2>

                The chart to the left shows the proportion of the Canadian population 
                that indentifies as Indigenous. As shown, a large majority of the population does not identify with 
                an Indigenous group. From the Indigenous groups, the First Nations make up a larger percent of the Indigenous
                population in Canada. Less than 2% of the population are Métis, and an even smaller percentage are Inuit. 
                With such a small percentage of Canadians that indentify as Indigenous, it raises the question of how this group
                and their traditions can be protected and preserved.

        <p class="description" style="float: left; width:30%; margin-left: 5%">This choropleth map represents the
             distribution of three types of indigenous populations in Canada. The map shows the percent Indigenous
              and the counts for First Nations, Inuit, and Métis populations for each province and territory. The 
              colors in the map vary in lightness based on the percentage of indigenous individuals in each 
              province/territory.  </p>

    <!-- Part 3 -->

    <h2 style="text-align: left; margin-left: 10%; margin-bottom: 0;">Mental Health and Mood Disorders in <br>Indigenous/Non Indigenous Peoples</h2>
    <div style="height: 120%; overflow: auto">
        <iframe src="media/scatter.html" title="scatter plot" style="float:left; height: 120%"></iframe>

        <p class="description" style="float: right; width:30%; margin-right: 5%;">There is a relationship between the self-reported mental 
            health variable on the x-axis and the clinically diagnosed mood disorder by a medical professional 
            variable on the y-axis. Based on the indigenous vs non-indigenous populations, the self-assessed 
            mental health correlates with the diagnosed mood disorder where the gray non-indigenous have a lower 
            crude rate (below 15% in both sexes) and the other values of indigenous populations have a high crude 
            rate of both variables (varying from 5% to 25% in both sexes). There is also an overall trend of 
            females having a higher crude rate of mood disorder and mental health than males do in both populations
             of indigenous and non-indigenous. The interactivity does add to this visualization because there are 
             so many variables - females, males, geography, domain, mental health, and mood disorder that are
              portrayed in one graph. The interactivity does align with Doumont’s talk in terms of what he says 
              because there is a minimized signal to noise ratio in this graph, and each label has a purpose to 
              the values and variables on the graph.

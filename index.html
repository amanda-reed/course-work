                The chart to the left shows the proportion of the Canadian population 
                that indentifies as Indigenous. As shown, a large majority of the population does not identify with 
                an Indigenous group. From the Indigenous groups, the First Nations make up a larger percent of the Indigenous
                population in Canada. Less than 2% of the population are Métis, and an even smaller percentage are Inuit. 
                With such a small percentage of Canadians that indentify as Indigenous, it raises the question of how this group
                and their traditions can be protected and preserved.

    <h2 style="text-align: right; margin-right: 20%; margin-bottom: 0;">Mental Health and Mood Disorders in <br>Indigenous/Non Indigenous Peoples</h2>
    <div style="height: 120%;">
        <p class="description" style="float: left; width:30%">There is a relationship between the self-reported mental 
            health variable on the x-axis and the clinically diagnosed mood disorder by a medical professional 
            variable on the y-axis. Based on the indigenous vs non-indigenous populations, the self-assessed 
            mental health correlates with the diagnosed mood disorder where the gray non-indigenous have a lower 
            crude rate (below 15% in both sexes) and the other values of indigenous populations have a high crude 
            rate of both variables (varying from 5% to 25% in both sexes). There is also an overall trend of 
            females having a higher crude rate of mood disorder and mental health than males do in both populations
             of indigenous and non-indigenous. The interactivity does add to this visualization because there are 
             so many variables - females, males, geography, domain, mental health, and mood disorder that are
              portrayed in one graph. The interactivity does align with Doumont’s talk in terms of what he says 
              because there is a minimized signal to noise ratio in this graph, and each label has a purpose to 
              the values and variables on the graph.

# Welcome! #
## Here's a bit about me ##
My name is Amanda Reed and I'm from the Greater Philadelphia area. I'm currently a senior at the College of William & Mary studying Computer Science with additional interests in data science,
math, and music. My experience is varied, including data analysis and visualization, test-driven software design, quality assurance workflow, as well as geospatial and data science research, 
both in a team and individual setting. I am currently an intern for Pacific Northwest National Laboratory where I've dived into front-end development in React, data visualization, and 
software testing. I'm interested in exploring possible career paths within the industry in an applied research setting.
